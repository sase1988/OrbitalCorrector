# Description:

This repository contains a set of scripts and modules that are used to perform the Orbital Correction on SAOCOM-1 images presented in this [work](https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLVI-4-W2-2021/167/2021/). In addition to this,there is a folder contaning sample data ready to use is included in order to try the correction.


# Sample Data:

The sample dataset contained in the **test_data** folder consists of a series of an interferometric pair of SAOCOM-1A images read to GMTSAR and two grid files generated by the same software which correspond to the filtered interferogram and the interferometric coherence, respectively. The folder also contains The XYZ grids that link the slant range geometry of this pair (column, row) with their actual cartesian coordinates. More information on how to read the SAOCOM-1 images to GMTSAR can be found [in this link](https://github.com/gmtsar/user-contributions/tree/main/saocom_slc).
